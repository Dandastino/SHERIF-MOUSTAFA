                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Photography is another great passion of mine, especially portraits. I love capturing people's expressions and emotions through the lens, aiming to tell a story with each shot. Photography, for me, is a way to freeze time and see the world in a new light. I am also learning to make the most of software like Photoshop and Premiere to enhance my skills in editing photos and videos. This passion drives me to refine every aspect of visual creation, making each image or video a unique and personal narrative.

        <h2>Intellectual Interests</h2>
        <p class="text">Programming is another one of my key interests. I find it to be an intellectually stimulating activity that allows me to combine logic and creativity in a productive way. Each new project presents a challenge that pushes me to continually improve and explore new horizons in computer science. My desire for learning extends beyond programming to areas such as <span class="highlight">finance, psychology, philosophy, and personal growth</span>. These subjects fascinate me because they help me better understand the world, its dynamics, and myself, providing valuable tools for personal development.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p class="text">Despite my many passions, I have not yet found a definitive answer to what I want to become. However, I believe that <span class="highlight">living in the present</span> with enthusiasm and a desire to learn is the best way to build my future. Every experience, every step I take, brings me closer to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and this is the true wealth I aim to cultivate.</p>
